# react-portfolio

With this project, i gave myself the task of recreating a portfolio using React.
​
## Getting Started
​
I initially started this project planning the layout and primary features i'd incorporate within. This proved a consistent challenge throughout as i quickly learned that the typical css library i use (Materialize) was not as compatible with react as bootstrap, which meant i couldn't use a lot of the features i enjoy working with. This conclusion was reached after hours of testing and definitely threw me for a loop.

My inital focus, once i reasearched react-bootstrap features a little, was to establish my components. This took far too much time as i wanted to change up my typical layout and create a fresh new look from anything in my previous projects. Safe to say this approach did not go well when jumping in blindly as i did, and probably could have been greatly avoided if i had only created a wireframe. Definitely doing this next time.

instead i waisted a rediculous amount of time revising and changing the layout over and over again. I'm Still not happy with it. Definitely not my best work by a long shot!! but it was good practice, i can say that much.

A majority of the challenges i encountered with Bootstrap specifically, apart from not being very familiar with it, were the css styling changes required to make the different aspects of my portfolio more interesting. I'll have to dedicate some more time planning before i start my next project, as bootstrap, though very useful, is not exactly packed full of interesting content. Also found that many of their built-in features don't quite function 100% of the time.

Normally i'd include more details of the design process along with images, parts of my code and features i enjoyed creating but this project was a bit of a mess to build. Will definitely know better for next time.
